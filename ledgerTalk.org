    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    | Payee        | Amount |
    | Paycheck     | + $100 |

    | Income:Paycheck         | -$100 |
    | Assets:Checking Account | -$20  |
    | Expenses:Stuff          | $20   |

* The Five Accounts

  - Assets
  - Expenses
  - Income
  - Liabilities
  - Equity
     
    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    - what you have
    - what you spend
    - what you earn
    - what you owe
    - what you own (assets - liabilities)

    Universal rules for these.
    - ie net worth = assets - liabilities
    - cash flow = income - expenses
    #+END_NOTES
** Accounting Equations

   - Net worth = Assets - Liabilities
   - Net income = Income - Expenses
